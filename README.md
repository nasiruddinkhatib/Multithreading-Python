Multithreading in Python
Multithreading in Python is used to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently to improve performance, especially in I/O-bound operations. The threading module in Python provides features to create and manage threads.

*Key Concepts of Multithreading*
Thread Creation - Creating multiple threads to run tasks concurrently.
Thread Synchronization - Managing shared resources to avoid conflicts.
Thread Communication - Using locks, events, and queues for safe data sharing.
